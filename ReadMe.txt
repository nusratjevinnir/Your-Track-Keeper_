ABOUT PROJECT:The main goal of this project is to make the life of a studentâ€™s campus life easier by providing some necessary information about faculties. The system 
will provide the faculty name, their working department, ID, course name, their cubicle number, building name, class time and their free time slot of running semester.
Using this system, the faculties can update their profile, the schedules of their classes, meetings, or other important scheduled that the university management 
assigns them. Students will be able to view these information when necessary. And an admin will maintain the signup, login and verification of valid membership 
procedure and update of both faculty and student account of the system.
